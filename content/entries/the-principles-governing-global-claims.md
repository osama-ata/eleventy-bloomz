# The Principles Governing 'Global Claims'

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Global claims recognize the practical reality that in complex construction projects, multiple concurrent causes of delay and disruption create synergistic effects that are impossible to separate precisely, while still requiring sufficient causal connection to justify recovery.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, enables recovery of total demonstrable loss caused by multiple concurrent events without need to quantify individual contributions, though burden remains on claimant to prove overall causation and exclude their own contributory factors.
