## Core Concept

**Elevator Pitch:** A doctrine preventing parties from claiming breach of contract where they have either made a clear choice to continue performance despite breach (election) or led the other party to believe breach is not being claimed (estoppel).

**Underlying Rationale:** Waiver protects legitimate expectations and prevents parties from blowing hot and cold by claiming breach after encouraging continued performance or accepting benefits of continued contractual relationship.

## Discovery

House of Lords distinguished waiver by election (irrevocable choice between inconsistent rights) from waiver by estoppel (preventing unconscionable departure from induced assumptions).

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Motor Oil Hellas (Corinth) Refineries SA v Shipping Corp of India [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 391** (1990) — House of Lords clarified requirements for waiver by estoppel: clear representation, reliance, and detriment, making it harder to establish than election.
- **Bremer Handelsgesellschaft mbH v Westzucker GmbH [1981] 2 Lloyd's Rep 130** (1981) — Established that knowledge of facts giving rise to right is essential for valid waiver by election - cannot elect between rights without knowing they exist.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Existing Right to Claim Breach** — There must be an actual breach of contract giving rise to enforceable rights (termination, damages, etc.) before waiver can occur.
- **Knowledge of Facts and Rights** — The waiving party must know the facts constituting breach and understand they have rights arising from it - no waiver without knowledge.
- **Unequivocal Conduct or Representation** — There must be clear conduct showing election between inconsistent rights or representation that breach is not being claimed.
- **Reliance and Detriment (for estoppel)** — For waiver by estoppel, the other party must have relied on the representation and suffered detriment that makes withdrawal unconscionable.

**Triggers:** Accepting continued performance after discovering breach, Requesting further performance instead of terminating contract, Accepting benefits or payments after breach occurs, Making statements that breach is waived or contract continues, Conduct inconsistent with claiming breach or termination

**Limitations:** Cannot waive future breaches, only past ones; Some serious breaches may be incapable of waiver; Waiver may be withdrawn before other party relies to their detriment; Must have full knowledge of facts and rights to make effective election; Contractual notice requirements may prevent implied waiver

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** A contractor delivers materials 10 days late in breach of contract, entitling the employer to terminate. Instead, the employer accepts the materials, pays for them, and instructs the contractor to proceed with the next phase of work. Two months later, facing project delays from other causes, the employer attempts to terminate the contract citing the original late delivery.

**Outcome:** The employer would likely be held to have waived the right to claim breach for late delivery through election. By accepting the materials, making payment, and instructing further work, they made a clear choice to continue the contract rather than terminate. This conduct was inconsistent with claiming breach and the contractor relied on it by performing additional work.

### Audience Adaptation

**For Client:** Waiver means you can lose the right to claim breach if you act as though the contract continues normally after problems occur. Be careful about accepting late performance, making payments, or asking for more work after discovering breaches, as this may waive your right to terminate or claim damages later. Always reserve your rights explicitly in writing when accepting performance you're not fully satisfied with.

**For Lawyer:** Waiver claims require careful analysis of timing, knowledge, and conduct. Key considerations: establish client had actual knowledge of breach and their rights; assess whether conduct was unequivocal election or mere forbearance; for estoppel, prove other party's reliance and detriment; consider whether waiver limited to specific breach or extends to pattern of conduct. Draft clear reservation of rights clauses to prevent inadvertent waiver.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Prove claimant knew of breach and their rights; demonstrate unequivocal conduct showing election to continue contract; establish reliance and detriment from other party; show conduct inconsistent with claiming breach; argue legitimate expectations created by claimant's behavior.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge whether party had full knowledge of breach and rights; argue conduct was mere forbearance not election; prove waiver was withdrawn before reliance; establish serious breach incapable of waiver; demonstrate explicit reservation of rights prevented waiver.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully established, permanently bars claims for the waived breach and may estop party from terminating contract for that breach, though future separate breaches may still be claimed if rights properly reserved.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent]] - Waiver may apply to conditions precedent, allowing performance to proceed even where conditions not strictly satisfied
- [[The Scott v Avery Clause (Arbitration as a Precondition to Litigation)]] - Waiver may excuse failure to comply with Scott v Avery clauses requiring arbitration before litigation
- [[The Doctrine of Total Failure of Consideration]] - Waiver by accepting performance may prevent claims for total failure of consideration
