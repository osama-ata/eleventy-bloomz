## Core Concept

**Elevator Pitch:** A contractual requirement that must be fulfilled before a party's obligation to perform becomes due, creating suspended rights and obligations that only become enforceable upon condition satisfaction.

**Underlying Rationale:** Conditions precedent allow parties to make performance contingent on specific events, protecting against unwanted obligations while providing certainty about when duties arise and potential escape routes if conditions fail.

## Discovery

Court of Appeal established distinction between conditions precedent to formation of contract versus conditions precedent to performance of existing contractual obligations.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Pym v Campbell (1856) 6 E&B 370** (1856) — Established that conditions precedent to contract formation prevent any contractual obligations arising until condition satisfied, distinguished from conditions precedent to performance.
- **Coloroll Pension Trustees Ltd v Russell [1994] 4 All ER 33** (1994) — House of Lords clarified that conditions precedent to performance suspend existing obligations rather than preventing contract formation, affecting remedy availability.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Clear Conditional Language** — Contract must use clear language showing obligation is conditional ('if', 'provided that', 'subject to', 'on condition that') rather than merely descriptive.
- **Identifiable Condition** — The condition must be precisely defined and objectively ascertainable, avoiding vague or subjective requirements that create uncertainty.
- **Logical Connection to Obligation** — There must be clear connection between the condition and the obligation it governs - condition must be relevant to performance trigger.
- **Possibility of Non-Fulfillment** — The condition must be capable of not being satisfied - automatic or inevitable events cannot function as true conditions precedent.

**Triggers:** Payment obligations subject to certificate issue or approval, Performance obligations conditional on obtaining permits or consents, Liability exclusions dependent on notice requirements, Contract commencement subject to financing or regulatory approval, Milestone payments conditional on achievement of specific objectives

**Limitations:** Courts construe conditions precedent strictly against party seeking to rely on them; May be waived by conduct or agreement of parties; Prevention principle prevents reliance on self-induced non-fulfillment; Some conditions may be deemed too uncertain to be enforceable; Consumer protection legislation may limit effectiveness in certain contexts

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** A construction contract states that the contractor's right to payment is 'subject to issue of architect's certificate confirming satisfactory completion of the relevant phase.' The contractor completes Phase 1 work but the architect refuses to issue a certificate due to minor defects that don't affect functionality. The contractor demands payment arguing the work is substantially complete.

**Outcome:** The certificate requirement is likely a condition precedent to payment, meaning no payment obligation arises until the certificate is issued. However, if the employer or architect prevents certificate issue unreasonably, the prevention principle may excuse the condition. The contractor's remedy would be to rectify defects to obtain the certificate or prove prevention to bypass the condition.

### Audience Adaptation

**For Client:** Conditions precedent are contractual 'gates' that must be opened before obligations become due. They protect you from having to perform or pay until specific requirements are met, but you must satisfy them exactly as written. Be careful about waiving conditions through your conduct, and remember you cannot rely on conditions you prevent from being satisfied. Use clear, objective language when drafting conditions to avoid disputes.

**For Lawyer:** Conditions precedent require careful drafting and strict compliance. Key issues: distinguish between conditions precedent to formation versus performance; assess whether language creates true condition or mere description of performance; consider prevention principle where client may be hindering condition satisfaction; analyze waiver potential through party conduct; evaluate whether condition is sufficiently certain to be enforceable.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Identify clear conditional language in contract; prove condition has not been satisfied according to its precise terms; establish that condition is precedent to claimed obligation; demonstrate no waiver through conduct; show prevention principle doesn't apply.

**Defensive argument:** Argue language creates description not condition; prove condition has been substantially satisfied; establish waiver through party conduct; invoke prevention principle if opponent hindered satisfaction; challenge condition as too uncertain to enforce.

### Legal Consequence

If condition precedent not satisfied, suspends obligation indefinitely until satisfaction occurs, providing complete defense to performance claims, though prevention by party seeking to rely on condition may excuse requirement.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Doctrine of Waiver (Waiver by Election and Waiver by Estoppel)]] - Conditions precedent may be waived through party conduct, particularly accepting performance despite non-satisfaction of conditions
- [[The Legal Concept of Force Majeure]] - Force majeure events may prevent satisfaction of conditions precedent, potentially excusing non-performance
- [[The 'Officious Bystander' Test for Implied Terms]] - May be used to determine whether unstated conditions should be implied into contracts
