## Core Concept

**Elevator Pitch:** A heightened form of duty that requires a defendant not only to take reasonable care themselves, but to ensure that reasonable care is taken by anyone performing functions on their behalf - creating liability for independent contractors' negligence in specific circumstances.

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine recognizes that in certain relationships characterized by vulnerability and dependency, it would be unjust to allow duty-bearers to escape liability by delegating critical functions to third parties. It ensures accountability where one party has assumed responsibility for another's safety or welfare.

## Discovery

Supreme Court established comprehensive framework for non-delegable duties, holding that a school owed pupils a non-delegable duty to ensure swimming lessons were conducted with reasonable care, creating liability for independent swimming instructor's negligence.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Cassidy v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 KB 343** (1951) — Early recognition that hospitals owed patients non-delegable duties to ensure competent medical treatment, regardless of whether doctors were employees or independent contractors.
- **McDermid v Nash Dredging [1987] AC 906** (1987) — House of Lords established employer's non-delegable duty to provide safe system of work for employees, creating liability for negligent systems even when operated by independent contractors.
- **Various Claimants v Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools [2012] UKSC 56** (2012) — Supreme Court extended non-delegable duty concept beyond traditional categories, focusing on relationships where defendant assumed responsibility for claimant's welfare and safety.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Vulnerable or Dependent Claimant** — The claimant must be a patient, child, or especially vulnerable person who depends on the defendant for protection from the risk of harm.
- **Antecedent Relationship of Control** — There must be a pre-existing relationship placing the claimant in the custody, charge, or care of the defendant, creating a positive duty to protect from harm.
- **Lack of Claimant Control** — The claimant must have no control over how the defendant chooses to perform its protective obligations, creating dependency on defendant's judgment.
- **Delegation of Integral Function** — The defendant must have delegated to a third party a function that is integral to the protective duty it has assumed toward the claimant.
- **Third Party Negligence in Delegated Function** — The third party must have been negligent in carrying out the very function that was delegated by the defendant and forms part of the defendant's assumed duty.

**Triggers:** Schools delegating educational or supervisory functions affecting pupil safety, Hospitals delegating patient care to independent medical practitioners, Employers delegating safety-critical functions affecting employee welfare, Public authorities delegating statutory functions affecting vulnerable individuals, Principal contractors delegating work affecting third party safety in certain circumstances

**Limitations:** Limited to relationships involving vulnerability and dependency; Does not apply to ordinary commercial relationships between equals; Requires delegation of function integral to assumed duty, not merely incidental; Third party must be performing defendant's function, not providing separate service; Criminal acts by third parties generally exclude non-delegable duty; Must be fair, just and reasonable to impose such extensive liability

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** A local authority contracts with an independent company to provide safety inspections of school playground equipment as part of its statutory duty to ensure pupil safety. The inspection company negligently fails to identify a dangerous defect in a climbing frame, and a child is seriously injured when the equipment collapses. The inspection company becomes insolvent before legal proceedings can be concluded.

**Outcome:** The local authority would likely be held liable under a non-delegable duty of care. The child is vulnerable and dependent on the authority for safety; the authority has statutory custody/care obligations; the child has no control over inspection arrangements; safety inspection is integral to the authority's protective duty; and the inspection company was negligent in performing the delegated safety function. The authority cannot escape liability despite delegating to a competent independent contractor who became insolvent.

### Audience Adaptation

**For Client:** A non-delegable duty means you remain legally responsible for ensuring certain functions are performed properly, even when you hire independent contractors to do the work. This applies mainly when you have special responsibility for vulnerable people (like children, patients, or employees) and you delegate safety-critical functions. Unlike normal situations where you're only liable if you choose contractors carelessly, non-delegable duties make you liable even if you pick competent contractors who then act negligently. This creates significant insurance and indemnity implications when contracting out core functions.

**For Lawyer:** Non-delegable duties represent the highest form of tort liability short of strict liability, requiring satisfaction of Woodland's five-stage test. Key analytical steps: assess vulnerability and dependency relationships; identify whether function delegated is integral to defendant's assumed protective duty; distinguish between defendant's duty and third party's separate obligations; consider policy factors affecting fair, just and reasonable test. Practical implications include insurance coverage gaps, indemnity clause importance, and careful selection of functions suitable for delegation. Consider interaction with vicarious liability principles and contribution rights.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Establish claimant's vulnerability and defendant's protective role; prove antecedent relationship creating custody/care obligations; demonstrate claimant's lack of control over protective arrangements; identify delegation of function integral to assumed duty; prove third party negligence in performing delegated function; argue policy justification for imposing comprehensive liability.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge existence of protective relationship or vulnerability; argue function delegated was separate service, not integral duty; prove claimant had control over arrangements; establish third party's independent role rather than delegated function; argue unfairness of imposing liability beyond defendant's control; invoke criminal conduct exception where applicable.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates primary liability for defendant regardless of third party's status as independent contractor, enabling full recovery from defendant who must then pursue contribution or indemnity rights against the negligent third party.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Doctrine of Vicarious Liability]] - Non-delegable duty creates primary liability distinct from vicarious liability's secondary liability, applying even where vicarious liability would not exist due to independent contractor status
- [[The Principle of Contribution Between Joint Tortfeasors]] - Defendants held liable under non-delegable duties retain contribution rights against negligent third parties under Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978
- [[The Doctrine of Subrogation in Insurance Matters]] - Insurance implications significant as non-delegable duties may not be covered by standard public liability policies designed for vicarious liability scenarios
