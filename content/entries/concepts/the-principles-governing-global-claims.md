## Core Concept

**Elevator Pitch:** A method of claiming additional costs where multiple causes of delay and disruption are so interlinked that their individual effects cannot be practically separated, allowing recovery based on total impact rather than cause-by-cause analysis.

**Underlying Rationale:** Global claims recognize the practical reality that in complex construction projects, multiple concurrent causes of delay and disruption create synergistic effects that are impossible to separate precisely, while still requiring sufficient causal connection to justify recovery.

## Discovery

First recognition that where multiple causes of delay are so complex and interrelated that separation is impractical, global claims may be acceptable if overall causal connection established.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Mid Glamorgan County Council v J Devonald Williams & Partner (1992) 29 Con LR 129** (1992) — Established that global claims require proof of causation between events claimed for and loss suffered, rejecting purely arithmetical approaches.
- **John Doyle Construction Ltd v Laing Management (Scotland) Ltd [2004] BLR 295** (2004) — Scottish court clarified that global claims must still establish causal connection and cannot be used simply to avoid burden of detailed analysis where separation is possible.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Multiple Concurrent Causes** — There must be multiple events or causes of delay/disruption that occurred during overlapping periods.
- **Practical Impossibility of Separation** — It must be genuinely impractical to separate the individual effects of different causes due to their complex interaction.
- **Overall Causal Connection** — There must be proven causal link between the events claimed for and the total loss suffered, even if individual contributions cannot be quantified.
- **Detailed Record of Events** — Comprehensive contemporaneous records of all events and their timing must be available to support the global approach.

**Triggers:** Complex projects with multiple concurrent delays and disruptions, Variations, defective instructions, and late information occurring simultaneously, Acceleration and disruption claims where effects are intertwined, Claims involving multiple parties and complex cause-and-effect relationships

**Limitations:** Cannot be used where individual causes can be practically separated; Requires proof of overall causation, not just temporal coincidence; Must exclude claimant's own contributory causes; Detailed contemporary records essential for credibility; Courts prefer specific cause-and-effect analysis where possible

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** During a complex hospital project, the contractor experiences: delayed design information from consultants, multiple variations ordered by client, defective specifications requiring rework, weather delays, and acceleration instructions - all occurring concurrently over 8 months. The combined effect causes significant disruption and additional costs totaling £2M, but separating individual effects is impossible due to overlapping impacts on resources, programming, and workflow.

**Outcome:** A global claim approach may succeed if the contractor can prove: all claimed events actually occurred and were not their fault; the events were so interlinked that separation is genuinely impractical; overall causal connection exists between the events and £2M loss; and detailed records support the total cost calculation. Courts would scrutinize whether individual separation was truly impossible.

### Audience Adaptation

**For Client:** Global claims let you recover costs where multiple problems hit your project simultaneously and created a 'perfect storm' that's impossible to untangle. However, courts are suspicious of global claims as they're often used to avoid detailed analysis. You must prove it's genuinely impossible to separate individual causes and maintain excellent records throughout. Success requires demonstrating clear links between all claimed events and your losses, excluding any problems you caused yourself.

**For Lawyer:** Global claims require careful case management and evidential preparation. Key requirements: establish genuine practical impossibility of separation through expert evidence; prove overall causation while excluding claimant's contributory factors; maintain detailed contemporary records of all events and impacts; consider whether any individual causes can be separated out; prepare for detailed scrutiny of whether global approach is justified. Alternative approaches like 'composite claims' for partial separation may be more successful.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Document all concurrent events with precise timing and impacts; engage experts to demonstrate practical impossibility of separation; establish clear overall causal connection between claimed events and total loss; exclude all claimant-caused factors; present detailed contemporary records supporting total cost approach.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge whether individual causes can be practically separated; dispute overall causation by identifying alternative causes; highlight claimant's contributory factors; question reliability of cost records; argue for detailed cause-and-effect analysis rather than global approach.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, enables recovery of total demonstrable loss caused by multiple concurrent events without need to quantify individual contributions, though burden remains on claimant to prove overall causation and exclude their own contributory factors.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Principles Governing 'Total Cost' Claims]] - Related approach focusing on total project cost overrun rather than specific events, with similar causation requirements
- [[The Doctrine of Waiver (Waiver by Election and Waiver by Estoppel)]] - May affect ability to claim globally if some events were waived or variations accepted without reservation
- [[Constructive Acceleration of Works]] - Often forms part of global claims where acceleration instructions compound other delays and disruptions
