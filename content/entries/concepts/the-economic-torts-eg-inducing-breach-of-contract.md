## Core Concept

**Elevator Pitch:** Torts protecting economic interests by imposing liability for intentionally interfering with contractual relations or causing economic loss through unlawful means.

**Underlying Rationale:** This principle addresses specific aspects of construction law relationships and liabilities, providing structured legal framework for the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) issues.

## Discovery

Foundational authority establishing the legal framework for the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) in construction and commercial law contexts.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Various subsequent developments** (2000) — Continued judicial and legislative refinement of the principle's application and scope in modern construction law.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Core Legal Requirement** — The fundamental requirement that must be established to successfully apply the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) in construction law contexts.
- **Factual Foundation** — The specific factual circumstances that must exist to trigger application of this legal principle.
- **Legal Consequence Test** — The test for determining when the principle's legal consequences should apply to the particular circumstances.

**Triggers:** Construction disputes involving the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract), Contractual relationships requiring application of this principle, Scenarios where traditional remedies are insufficient

**Limitations:** Limited to specific factual circumstances; May be excluded by express contractual terms; Subject to other overriding legal principles

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** A construction scenario where the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) becomes relevant to resolving disputes between contracting parties.

**Outcome:** Application of the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) principles would determine the legal rights and obligations of the parties involved.

### Audience Adaptation

**For Client:** This principle affects your construction project by governing the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) issues. Understanding its application helps manage risk and legal exposure.

**For Lawyer:** Legal analysis of the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) requires careful consideration of precedent, statutory framework, and specific factual matrix of each case.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Establish the factual and legal requirements for the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) and demonstrate their application to the specific circumstances.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge the applicability of the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) by disputing facts, legal interpretation, or availability of alternative legal approaches.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates specific legal rights and obligations under the economic torts (e.g., inducing breach of contract) framework.
