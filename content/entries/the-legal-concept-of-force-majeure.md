# The Legal Concept of Force Majeure

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Force majeure clauses allocate the risk of extraordinary events between contracting parties in a predictable way, avoiding the harsh all-or-nothing consequences of frustration doctrine. They recognize that certain events are genuinely beyond any party's control and should not result in breach liability while maintaining the contractual relationship.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, suspends or modifies contractual obligations during the event period, typically providing time extensions without penalty, though cost implications depend on specific clause terms and may not excuse payment obligations.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Doctrine of Frustration of Contract]]
* [[The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent]]
* [[The Doctrine of Waiver (Waiver by Election and Waiver by Estoppel)]]
