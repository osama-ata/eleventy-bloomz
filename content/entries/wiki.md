This page is the canonical "Contracts Wiki" entry used by internal wikilinks such as [[contracts-wiki]].

## Purpose

A short, curated index and starting point for topics and pages related to contract law, contract clauses, and practical drafting notes. Use this page to collect links, definitions, and references that are frequently useful across the site.

## What to include

- Links to deeper articles.
- Practical drafting pointers and template clauses.
- References to case law or statutes.

## Example links

- [[legal-concepts]]
- [[legal-cases]]

## Notes

Keep this page focused and link-heavy. Prefer links to existing entries rather than long, duplicated explanations. When adding new short notes, prefer using wikilinks to create discoverability across the site.
