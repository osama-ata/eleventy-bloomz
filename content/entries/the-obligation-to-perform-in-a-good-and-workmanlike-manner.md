## Core Concept

### Elevator Pitch

An implied contractual obligation requiring contractors to perform work using the ordinary skill, efficiency, and knowledge possessed by those working in the relevant trade or business - establishing a reasonable competence standard without guaranteeing specific results.

### Underlying Rationale

The doctrine ensures that construction work meets industry standards and protects employers from substandard performance, while avoiding the harshness of strict liability by focusing on process and method rather than guaranteed outcomes. It balances reasonable expectations with practical limitations of construction work.

## Discovery

Established that any contract to perform work imposes on the contractor the duty to perform the work in a workmanlike manner, defined as the way work is customarily done by other contractors in the community.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Defective Premises Act 1972** (1972) — Statutory codification requiring contractors working on dwellings to work in a professional or workmanlike manner and use proper materials, with parties unable to exclude this statutory duty.
- **Building Regulations 2010, Regulation 7** (2010) — Requires that building work shall be carried out in a workmanlike manner, with Approved Document 7 defining this as workmanship where materials are adequately applied to perform their functions.
- **Various trade association standards** (2000) — Development of specific performance standards by organizations like Metropolitan Builders Association and NARI to provide more precise definitions of acceptable workmanship quality.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Trade or Business Competency** — The contractor must possess and employ the ordinary skill of their trade, demonstrated through training, experience, or professional standing in the relevant construction field.
- **Community Standards Compliance** — Work must meet the standards customarily achieved by other contractors in the same community or geographic area performing similar work.
- **Proper Materials and Methods** — Materials must be of good quality and reasonably fit for their purpose, applied using appropriate techniques and methods recognized in the industry.
- **Contract Specifications Adherence** — Work must be performed according to plans, specifications, and contractual requirements, unless those specifications are themselves defective or impossible.

**Triggers:** Any construction contract (implied even if not expressly stated), Residential building work under Defective Premises Act 1972, Building work requiring compliance with Building Regulations, Professional services contracts involving construction elements

**Limitations:** Does not require perfection - reasonable trade standards suffice; Limited by what is technically and economically feasible; May be modified by express contractual terms setting different standards; Expertise level adjusted to contractor's represented capabilities; Time and budget constraints may affect expected standard

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** XYZ Roofing Ltd contracts to replace a residential roof using specific tiles and installation methods. Upon completion, several tiles become loose within six months due to inadequate fixing, and water penetration occurs. Investigation reveals the tiles were attached using fewer fixings than recommended by the manufacturer and industry standards, though the tiles themselves were of correct specification.

**Outcome:** XYZ Roofing would be in breach of the workmanlike manner obligation because they failed to use proper installation methods recognized in the roofing trade, regardless of using correct materials. The homeowner can recover repair costs and consequential damage.

### Audience Adaptation

#### For Client

This obligation means your contractor must perform work to the standard you'd expect from a competent tradesperson in your area - not perfect, but professionally acceptable. If work falls below this standard, you have grounds for complaint even without proving negligence. However, the standard is measured against industry norms, not your personal preferences, and contractors aren't required to achieve impossible results.

#### For Lawyer

The workmanlike manner standard creates a negligence-based liability focusing on process rather than outcome. Key issues include: defining the relevant trade standards and geographic community; expert evidence requirements to establish breach; interaction with express contractual terms; and whether the standard is adjusted for the contractor's represented skill level. Consider the relationship with professional negligence principles and the burden of proof for establishing deviation from accepted practice.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Establish the relevant trade standards through expert evidence; demonstrate deviation from accepted industry practices; prove the contractor held themselves out as competent in the relevant trade; show that proper materials or methods were not used; establish that the defect resulted from poor workmanship rather than design issues.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge the definition of relevant community standards; argue work met acceptable trade practices at the time; demonstrate compliance with contractual specifications; prove any defects resulted from design problems or employer-supplied materials; establish that higher standards were not contractually required or economically feasible.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates liability for breach of contract based on failure to meet reasonable trade standards, enabling recovery of remedial costs and consequential losses, but limited to what a competent tradesperson should reasonably have achieved.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Implied Duty of Fitness for Purpose]] - Provides higher standard focusing on results rather than process - workmanlike manner is process-focused alternative where fitness for purpose cannot be established
- [[The Doctrine of Incorporation of Terms by Reference]] - May incorporate specific industry standards or codes of practice that define workmanlike performance
- [[The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent]] - Quality of workmanship may be a condition precedent to payment under construction contracts
