# The Obligation to Perform in a 'Good and Workmanlike Manner'

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine ensures that construction work meets industry standards and protects employers from substandard performance, while avoiding the harshness of strict liability by focusing on process and method rather than guaranteed outcomes. It balances reasonable expectations with practical limitations of construction work.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates liability for breach of contract based on failure to meet reasonable trade standards, enabling recovery of remedial costs and consequential losses, but limited to what a competent tradesperson should reasonably have achieved.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Implied Duty of Fitness for Purpose]]
* [[The Doctrine of Incorporation of Terms by Reference]]
* [[The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent]]
