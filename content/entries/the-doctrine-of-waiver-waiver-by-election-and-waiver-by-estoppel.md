# The Doctrine of Waiver (Waiver by Election and Waiver by Estoppel)

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Waiver protects legitimate expectations and prevents parties from blowing hot and cold by claiming breach after encouraging continued performance or accepting benefits of continued contractual relationship.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully established, permanently bars claims for the waived breach and may estop party from terminating contract for that breach, though future separate breaches may still be claimed if rights properly reserved.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent]]
* [[The Scott v Avery Clause (Arbitration as a Precondition to Litigation)]]
* [[The Doctrine of Total Failure of Consideration]]
