# The Concept of a Non-Delegable Duty of Care

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine recognizes that in certain relationships characterized by vulnerability and dependency, it would be unjust to allow duty-bearers to escape liability by delegating critical functions to third parties. It ensures accountability where one party has assumed responsibility for another's safety or welfare.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates primary liability for defendant regardless of third party's status as independent contractor, enabling full recovery from defendant who must then pursue contribution or indemnity rights against the negligent third party.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Doctrine of Vicarious Liability]]
* [[The Principle of Contribution Between Joint Tortfeasors]]
* [[The Doctrine of Subrogation in Insurance Matters]]
