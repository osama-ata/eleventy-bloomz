# The Doctrine of Frustration of Contract

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine prevents harsh outcomes where parties would otherwise remain bound by impossible or fundamentally altered obligations due to unforeseeable events. It recognizes that contracting parties cannot anticipate every possible circumstance and provides relief where continued performance would be unjust or meaningless.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, automatically terminates the contract from the point of frustration, discharging both parties from future obligations, with potential statutory adjustment of losses and recovery of benefits under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943.
