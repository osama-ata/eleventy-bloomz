# The Doctrine of Vicarious Liability

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine serves multiple policy objectives: ensuring adequate compensation for victims by targeting defendants with greater financial resources; incentivizing employers to exercise proper supervision and control over employees; and recognizing that employers benefit from employee activities and should bear associated risks.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates joint and several liability between employer and employee, allowing claimant to recover full damages from employer regardless of employee's ability to pay, though employer may seek contribution from employee under Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978.
