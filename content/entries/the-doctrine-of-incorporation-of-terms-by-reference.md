# The Doctrine of Incorporation of Terms by Reference

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Incorporation by reference provides practical mechanism for including complex external materials while requiring sufficient clarity to identify what is incorporated and ensuring parties understand they are bound by referenced terms.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully established, makes external document terms fully enforceable as part of the contract, subject to express contract terms taking precedence in case of irreconcilable conflict.
