# The Implied Duty of Fitness for Purpose

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine shifts risk allocation from the employer to the contractor/designer where the employer has relied on the professional's expertise to deliver a specific outcome. It protects clients who lack technical expertise to assess process rather than merely results, particularly where the professional has held themselves out as capable of achieving the intended purpose.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates strict liability for failure to achieve intended purpose, enabling recovery of direct and consequential losses without proof of negligence, but potentially voiding professional indemnity insurance coverage for the liable party.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Obligation to Perform in a 'Good and Workmanlike Manner']]
* [[The Doctrine of Incorporation of Terms by Reference]]
* [[The 'Officious Bystander' Test for Implied Terms]]
