## Core Concept

### Elevator Pitch

An absolute contractual duty requiring construction professionals to ensure their design or completed works achieve the intended purpose, regardless of the level of skill, care, or effort applied - creating liability even without negligence.

### Underlying Rationale

The doctrine shifts risk allocation from the employer to the contractor/designer where the employer has relied on the professional's expertise to deliver a specific outcome. It protects clients who lack technical expertise to assess process rather than merely results, particularly where the professional has held themselves out as capable of achieving the intended purpose.

## Discovery

Established that contractors supplying materials impliedly warrant their fitness for purpose unless expressly excluded, extending Sale of Goods Act principles to construction contracts.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **IBA v EMI Electronics and BICC Construction Ltd** (1980) — Clarified that design and build contractors owe fitness for purpose obligations for design elements unless contract terms limit liability to reasonable skill and care standard.
- **Greaves & Co (Contractors) Ltd v Baynham Meikle & Partners** (1975) — Established that where a contractor undertakes design responsibility and the intended purpose is made known, fitness for purpose obligation is implied even for professional services.
- **MT Højgaard A/S v E.ON Climate & Renewables UK Robin Rigg East Limited** (2017) — Supreme Court confirmed fitness for purpose obligations can arise even where design complies with applicable standards, emphasizing the absolute nature of the duty and insurance implications.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Professional Activity by Non-Professional** — A contractor or designer must be undertaking work of a professional nature while not being bound by professional negligence standards (typically in design and build contracts).
- **Known Purpose** — The intended purpose of the works or design must be made known to the contractor/designer, either expressly or by clear implication from the circumstances.
- **Reliance on Skill and Expertise** — The employer must have relied on the contractor's/designer's skill and expertise to achieve the specified purpose, rather than merely following detailed specifications provided by others.
- **Absence of Express Contrary Terms** — The contract must not contain express terms limiting liability to reasonable skill and care, as such terms will generally exclude the implied fitness for purpose obligation.

**Triggers:** Design and build contracts where contractor provides both design and construction services, Supply of materials and goods by contractors (unless expressly excluded), Professional services where specific performance outcomes are specified, Specialist contractor appointments where particular expertise is relied upon

**Limitations:** Express contractual terms limiting liability to reasonable skill and care; Detailed specifications provided by employer removing contractor's design discretion; Professional indemnity insurance exclusions for fitness for purpose obligations; Statutory limitations under Building Act 1984 and Limitation Act 1980; Unforeseeability of the particular damage (post Cambridge Water Co principles)

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** ABC Construction Ltd enters a design and build contract to construct a swimming pool facility for a hotel, with the contract specifying the pool must be suitable for commercial use and accommodate 200 guests daily. ABC designs and builds the pool, but the filtration system proves inadequate for the specified capacity, causing frequent closures and loss of business despite ABC having exercised reasonable skill and care in design and used industry-standard components.

**Outcome:** ABC would be liable under the implied fitness for purpose obligation because they failed to deliver a pool fit for its intended commercial purpose, regardless of having met reasonable professional standards. The hotel can recover consequential losses flowing from the breach.

### Audience Adaptation

#### For Client

This obligation means you're paying for results, not just effort. If your contractor agrees to deliver something for a specific purpose and it doesn't work as intended, they're liable even if they weren't negligent. However, this protection only applies if you haven't provided detailed specifications yourself and have relied on their expertise. Contractors often try to exclude this obligation, so check your contract terms carefully and consider the insurance implications.

#### For Lawyer

The fitness for purpose obligation creates strict liability requiring careful risk assessment and contract drafting. Key contentious points include: whether the obligation has been excluded by express terms; the scope of 'purpose' and foreseeability of damage; the interaction with professional negligence principles; and insurance coverage gaps. Consider BP Refinery tests for implying terms, examine the professional/non-professional distinction from Samuels v Davis, and assess practical impossibility of separation defenses.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Assert that defendant held themselves out as capable of achieving specific purpose; demonstrate employer's reliance on defendant's expertise; prove known or obvious intended purpose; show absence of express skill and care limitations; establish that purpose was not achieved regardless of defendant's efforts or compliance with standards.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge whether purpose was clearly communicated or foreseeable; argue express contractual terms limit liability to skill and care; demonstrate employer provided detailed specifications removing design discretion; prove professional indemnity insurance exclusions void coverage; establish practical impossibility of achieving purpose within contractual constraints.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates strict liability for failure to achieve intended purpose, enabling recovery of direct and consequential losses without proof of negligence, but potentially voiding professional indemnity insurance coverage for the liable party.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Obligation to Perform in a Good and Workmanlike Manner]] - Provides alternative, less onerous standard focusing on process rather than outcome - often used where fitness for purpose cannot be established
- [[The Doctrine of Incorporation of Terms by Reference]] - Relevant for determining whether fitness for purpose obligations arise from incorporated standards or specifications
- [[The Officious Bystander Test for Implied Terms]] - Applied to determine whether fitness for purpose obligation should be implied based on business necessity and obviousness
