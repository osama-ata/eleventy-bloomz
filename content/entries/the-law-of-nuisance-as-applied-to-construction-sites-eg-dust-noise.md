# The Law of Nuisance as Applied to Construction Sites (e.g., dust, noise)

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Construction nuisance law balances economic development needs against individual property rights, recognizing that some interference is inevitable during building work while protecting against excessive or unreasonable disruption.

## Legal Consequence

If established, enables recovery of damages for property diminution, additional costs, and discomfort, plus potential injunctive relief to prevent continuation of unreasonable interference, though courts balance public interest in development.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Rule in Rylands v Fletcher (Strict Liability)]]
* [[The Law of Trespass as Applied to Construction]]
* [[The Legal Concept of Force Majeure]]
