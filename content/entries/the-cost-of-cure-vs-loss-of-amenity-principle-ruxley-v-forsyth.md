# The 'Cost of Cure' vs. 'Loss of Amenity' Principle (Ruxley v Forsyth)

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The principle prevents unjust enrichment while recognizing that contractual promises have value beyond mere financial enhancement. It balances the fundamental rule that damages should put the innocent party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed, against the need for proportionate and reasonable remedies.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, limits damages to reasonable amount reflecting actual loss rather than theoretical reinstatement cost, preventing economically wasteful outcomes while still providing compensation for genuine disappointment and lost consumer surplus.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Obligation to Perform in a 'Good and Workmanlike Manner']]
* [[The 'No Loss' Defence in Claims for Breach]]
* [[The Doctrine of Total Failure of Consideration]]
