# The Principles Governing 'Total Cost' Claims

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Total cost claims recognize that in complex disrupted projects, tracking specific costs to specific causes may be impractical, while requiring claimants to prove that cost overruns resulted from compensable events rather than their own performance failures.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, enables recovery based on total cost differential between tender and actual costs, subject to court/arbitrator assessment of contributory factors and potential reduction for contractor responsibility or unreasonable costs.
