## Core Concept

### Elevator Pitch

A damages calculation method comparing total actual project costs against total budgeted costs to establish loss, used when traditional cost build-up is impractical but requiring proof that excess costs resulted from compensable events rather than contractor inefficiency.

### Underlying Rationale

Total cost claims recognize that in complex disrupted projects, tracking specific costs to specific causes may be impractical, while requiring claimants to prove that cost overruns resulted from compensable events rather than their own performance failures.

## Discovery

English court addressed total cost methodology, emphasizing need to establish causal connection between compensable events and cost overruns while excluding contractor's own inefficiencies.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Various US federal contracting cases** (1970) — US courts developed strict requirements: actual costs were reasonable; tender was realistic; excess costs caused by defendant's breaches; claimant not responsible for cost overruns.
- **Modern construction arbitrations** (2000) — Arbitrators increasingly accept modified total cost approaches where some cost breakdown is possible, reducing reliance on pure total cost methodology.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Reasonable Actual Costs** — The costs actually incurred must be reasonable and properly documented, excluding wasteful or inefficient expenditure.
- **Realistic Original Budget** — The original tender or budget must have been realistic and based on accurate information available at the time.
- **Compensable Causation** — The cost overrun must be caused by compensable events (employer breaches, variations, etc.) rather than contractor performance failures.
- **No Contractor Responsibility** — The claimant must not be responsible for the cost overruns through their own inefficiency, poor planning, or contractual breaches.

**Triggers:** Severely disrupted projects where cost tracking to specific causes is impractical, Projects with extensive variations and changes making original cost structure meaningless, Situations where detailed cost build-up would be prohibitively expensive or complex, Fast-track projects with inadequate time for detailed cost analysis

**Limitations:** Courts strongly prefer detailed cost build-up where possible; High burden to prove all four essential elements; Must exclude all contractor-caused cost increases; Vulnerable to challenges on original tender realism; May be reduced by court/arbitrator assessment of contributory factors

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** A contractor's original £10M tender becomes £15M actual cost due to extensive employer-instructed variations, late information, defective design, and multiple scope changes that completely disrupted planned work sequence. Detailed cost tracking became impossible due to the chaotic nature of the work, but the contractor maintained overall project cost records showing the £5M overrun.

**Outcome:** A total cost claim might succeed if the contractor proves: the £15M actual costs were reasonable (no waste/inefficiency); the original £10M tender was realistic based on available information; the £5M overrun was caused by employer's breaches/variations; and the contractor's own performance didn't contribute to cost increases. Courts would scrutinize whether detailed analysis was truly impossible.

### Audience Adaptation

#### For Client

Total cost claims are a last resort when your project costs spiral but you can't track exactly which problems caused which costs. You must prove your original price was realistic, your actual costs were reasonable, the overrun was caused by the employer's actions (not your mistakes), and detailed cost tracking was genuinely impossible. Courts dislike this approach as it can hide inefficiency, so expect tough scrutiny and consider whether some cost breakdown is possible.

#### For Lawyer

Total cost claims require meeting strict US-derived tests and overcoming judicial skepticism. Key challenges: proving original tender realism through contemporary evidence; demonstrating reasonableness of actual costs with detailed records; establishing causal connection between compensable events and overruns; excluding all contractor contributory factors. Consider modified total cost approaches allowing partial cost breakdown. Expert accounting evidence essential for credibility.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Establish original tender realism through contemporary documents and expert evidence; prove reasonableness of actual costs through detailed accounting records; demonstrate compensable causation through project chronology and expert analysis; exclude contractor contributory factors; show impracticality of detailed cost allocation.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge original tender realism through market analysis and bid documents; identify unreasonable or inflated actual costs; prove contractor inefficiency or performance failures caused cost increases; demonstrate that detailed cost breakdown is possible; highlight alternative causes of cost overruns.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, enables recovery based on total cost differential between tender and actual costs, subject to court/arbitrator assessment of contributory factors and potential reduction for contractor responsibility or unreasonable costs.

## Relevant Principles

- [[the-principles-governing-global-claims]] - Related methodology focusing on multiple concurrent causes rather than total cost comparison, often used together in complex claims
- [[the-no-loss-defence-in-claims-for-breach]] - Defendants may argue no loss occurred if project was ultimately profitable or contractor would have made losses anyway
- [[The Doctrine of Waiver]] - May affect ability to claim total costs if variations or changes were accepted without proper reservation of rights
