# The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** Conditions precedent allow parties to make performance contingent on specific events, protecting against unwanted obligations while providing certainty about when duties arise and potential escape routes if conditions fail.

## Legal Consequence

If condition precedent not satisfied, suspends obligation indefinitely until satisfaction occurs, providing complete defense to performance claims, though prevention by party seeking to rely on condition may excuse requirement.

## Relevant Principles

* [[The Legal Concept of Force Majeure]]
* [[The 'Officious Bystander' Test for Implied Terms]]
