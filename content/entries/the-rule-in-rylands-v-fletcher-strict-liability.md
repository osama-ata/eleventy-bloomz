## Core Concept

### Elevator Pitch

A strict liability rule holding persons liable for damage caused when dangerous substances escape from their land during non-natural use, regardless of fault or negligence - creating absolute liability for certain construction activities involving hazardous materials or operations.

### Underlying Rationale

The doctrine balances individual rights to use land freely against neighbors' rights to be protected from extraordinary risks. It places liability on those who create exceptional dangers for profit or benefit, ensuring victims can recover without proving negligence.

## Discovery

House of Lords established that those bringing dangerous substances onto land for non-natural use are strictly liable for damage caused by escape, regardless of fault. Fletcher's mill flooded when Rylands' reservoir burst through abandoned mine shafts.

### Evolution / Key Cases and Sources

- **Cambridge Water Co v Eastern Counties Leather [1994] 2 AC 264** (1994) — House of Lords modernized the rule by requiring reasonable foreseeability of damage type, limiting strict liability while maintaining core principle for industrial activities.
- **Transco plc v Stockport MBC [2003] UKHL 61** (2003) — House of Lords clarified 'non-natural use' test, emphasizing extraordinary risk creation rather than mere artificiality, and rejected calls to abolish the rule entirely.
- **Stannard v Gore [2012] EWCA Civ 1248** (2012) — Court of Appeal applied rule to fire spreading from deliberate burning of tires, confirming continued relevance for construction activities involving fire or combustible materials.

## Deconstruction

### Essential Elements Test

- **Bringing Onto Land** — The defendant must have brought or accumulated something on their land that was not naturally present, including materials, substances, or artificial structures.
- **Non-Natural Use** — The use must create extraordinary risk to neighbors - assessed by whether it brings special hazards beyond those associated with ordinary use of land in the locality.
- **Escape** — The dangerous thing must escape from the defendant's control and beyond the land where they had right to keep it, causing damage to neighboring property.
- **Foreseeable Damage Type** — Following Cambridge Water, the type of damage caused must be reasonably foreseeable, though the specific incident or extent need not be foreseeable.

**Triggers:** Construction activities involving stored chemicals, fuels, or hazardous materials, Excavation causing escape of groundwater or contamination, Pile driving or blasting causing vibrations affecting neighboring structures, Storage of materials that could escape and cause damage, Construction fires spreading to neighboring property

**Limitations:** Damage caused by natural phenomena (Acts of God) excludes liability; Plaintiff's own default or consent to the accumulation provides defense; Statutory authority may provide defense if escape inevitable from authorized activity; Common benefit situations where both parties benefit from the activity; Must be non-natural use creating extraordinary rather than ordinary risks

## Dissemination

### Hypothetical Example

**Scenario:** A construction company stores large quantities of diesel fuel on-site for heavy machinery during a major infrastructure project. During heavy rainfall, poor containment allows fuel to escape and contaminate the neighboring market garden's soil and groundwater, destroying crops and requiring expensive remediation. The construction company followed industry standards for fuel storage but had not anticipated the severity of the rainfall.

### Audience Adaptation

#### For Client

Rylands v Fletcher creates automatic liability for certain construction activities regardless of how careful you are. If you bring dangerous materials onto your site and they escape and cause damage, you'll be liable even if you followed all safety procedures. This applies particularly to fuel storage, chemical use, excavation affecting water flow, and activities creating vibrations or other hazards that could affect neighbors. Ensure comprehensive insurance coverage and consider whether activities truly require hazardous materials or create extraordinary risks.

#### For Lawyer

Rylands v Fletcher claims require careful analysis of the non-natural use test following Transco, focusing on extraordinary risk creation rather than mere artificiality. Key considerations: assess whether defendant's activity creates special hazards beyond ordinary land use; establish actual escape beyond defendant's land (distinguish from purely internal damage); prove reasonable foreseeability of damage type per Cambridge Water; consider available defenses including Act of God, default of plaintiff, and statutory authority. Insurance coverage often excluded for strict liability claims.

## Deployment

### Application

**Affirmative argument:** Identify dangerous substance or activity brought onto defendant's land; establish non-natural use creating extraordinary risks to neighbors; prove escape beyond defendant's property causing damage; demonstrate reasonable foreseeability of damage type; emphasize strict liability eliminates need to prove negligence or fault.

**Defensive argument:** Challenge whether use constitutes non-natural use rather than ordinary land use for the locality; argue no actual escape occurred or damage was caused by factors other than escape; invoke Act of God defense for natural phenomena; prove plaintiff's consent or default; establish statutory authority defense; challenge foreseeability of damage type.

### Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates strict liability for all foreseeable damage caused by escape, enabling full recovery without proof of negligence, though defendant retains limited defenses and may have contribution rights against other parties who contributed to the escape.

## Relevant Principles

- [[The Doctrine of Vicarious Liability]] - Rylands v Fletcher imposes primary strict liability on land users, distinct from vicarious liability which requires relationship and fault by third party
- [[The Law of Nuisance as Applied to Construction Sites]] - Rylands v Fletcher overlaps with nuisance but provides stricter liability for escape scenarios where nuisance might require proof of unreasonableness
- [[The Principle of Contribution Between Joint Tortfeasors]] - Multiple parties may contribute to escape scenarios, enabling contribution claims between joint tortfeasors under Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978
