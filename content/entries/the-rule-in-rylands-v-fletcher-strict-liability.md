# The Rule in Rylands v Fletcher (Strict Liability)

## Core Concept

**Underlying Rationale:** The doctrine balances individual rights to use land freely against neighbors' rights to be protected from extraordinary risks. It places liability on those who create exceptional dangers for profit or benefit, ensuring victims can recover without proving negligence.

## Legal Consequence

If successfully applied, creates strict liability for all foreseeable damage caused by escape, enabling full recovery without proof of negligence, though defendant retains limited defenses and may have contribution rights against other parties who contributed to the escape.
